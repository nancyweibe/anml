            <span class="op-05">Are you a creative leader with a passion for solving problems? ANML is looking for a self motivated hybrid design junkie with a portfolio full of digital work that showcases their passion for the craft.</span>
          </div>
          <p class="mw-700">You’re able to energize the team and help keep everyone focused on the goal. You must meet deadlines, be mindful of budgets, and be able to explain design decisions to executive level clients. You value collaboration and team effort, but are accountable when given ownership.</p>
          <p class="mw-700 mb-0">Different from the big agency life, and far from the cubed existence, ANML’s small team is tucked at the bottom of the Santa Cruz mountains in the historic town of Los Gatos. Just 30 minutes from surf and a steps away from trails, ANML’s location balances the excitement of the Silicon Valley with the calm of nature in our backyard.</p>
